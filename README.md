# AI-Incident-Research

This repository exists to open source our manipulations of the AI Incident Database, found at: https://incidentdatabase.ai, as well as our various usage of the database to encourage further research.

The csv folder includes:
final.csv - Our finalized csv after all data cleaning, processing, and modeling.

The src folder includes:
initialClean.R - The first part of the pipeline which removes redundant variables, cleans titles + descriptions, and arranges the dataset by date.
